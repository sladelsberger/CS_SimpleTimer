Project: Simple Timer

Purpose: To have a visual representation of how long a person has been away from their computer. This can help the user to take a break from their computer which is very helpful when it comes to a person's health. We spend so much time staring at computer screens now that, sometimes, a small visual representation is all we need to remind us to take a break for an allotted amount of time.

What I've Learned: This is one of my first real "on my own" project. Up until this point I have been mainly doing either tutorial learing or solving a small scale problem that is given to me. But this is the first time that I have taken the knowledge that I have accummulated and really put it all together to form an applicable program. And it feels GREAT!! It has reinforced things that I have already learned and continued to push me to research the information that I don't quite know yet, but need to piece everything all together. 

Future Aspirations: For this project, I would like to continue to refine it so that the user of this extension could input how long they would like to be on Chrome and then after that length of time, Chrome will inform the user to take a break for a specified length of time. During this "break time" a new tab could open up with inspirational messages, messages on staying healty, beautiful outdoor scenery, and the such. At the end of this "break time" some sort of ding or tone can play signifying that they may continue on Chrome. Everything of course being fully customizable by the user.
